## Progressive Casualty Insurance -- *Lead Data Analyst* {.company-box .pgr-box}

2019 - Present | 2022 - Present (at Lead level)

### Highlighted role achievements

<div class='company-bullets'>
- Replaced tabular estimation of core team metrics with statistical models, reducing run-time and providing a framework to interpret variable effects and model parsimony.
- Modeled claims adjuster productivity using zero-inflated negative binomial GLM using R package `pscl` as well as non-linear mixed-effects modeling with R package `brms`, developing theory for an alternative staffing criterion.
- Forecasted risk of when claim ID numbers might exceed limits using Bayesian generalized linear regression with R package `rstanarm`, providing a recommended date for the start of a large-scale effort to increase claim ID size.
- Increased efficiency by approximately 80 FTE using a data pipeline in python to quantify auto inspector drive times using location information and Google Maps Distance Matrix API.
- Improved team efficiency by creating an interactive framework in the form of a web application for comparing adjustments to our staff model, abstracting a previously labor-intensive manual process.
- Recast central team SQL dataset using delta compression to reduce storage size by over 5x and reduce analyst time spent writing lengthy and repetitive queries.
- Experienced in several SQL frameworks (TSQL, DB2, Snowflake, SQLite, duckdb) creating complex queries joining several tables each with hundreds of millions of records.
</div>

### Contributions additional to role

<div class='company-bullets'>
- Won 1st Prize in the 2024 Inviztational, a company-wide visualization challenge for a prize of $2000, presenting a dynamic visualization displaying satellite imagery of hurricanes over their lifespan.
- Developed and taught a curriculum for a dual R and Python course to 25 attendees over a 9 month period.
- Enforced code best-practices, introduced collaborative git workflows to our team, and checked critical code into Github repositories.
- Developed several R and python packages including tools to eliminate boilerplate in SQL connections, extend `ggplot2` with a company color palette, and other miscellaneous functions.
- Spent over 100 hours between 2021 and 2024 providing one-on-one support to analysts all over the company supporting R, Python, and SQL questions.
- Led bi-weekly R Clinic support sessions as the R SME for Progressive (ongoing).
- Assisted in testing of Posit corporate productivity software, as well as an in-house python cloud platform.
- Won 2nd place in SPrize 2021, a company-wide predictive modeling challenge, involving over 15 teams.

## Cornell University -- *Graduate Research Assistant* {.company-box .cornell-box}

2015 - 2018

<div class='company-bullets'>
- Gained competency with Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, geostatistical modeling, maximum likelihood optimization procedures, and generalized linear models.
- Developed two novel statistical models that use MCMC to estimate animal population size and relationships with spatial habitat covariates, applied to moose in New York.
- The statistical models' performance was tested via simulation analysis using high-performance computing techniques under an original dual-layer parallelization scheme of a cluster of computers.
- Applied motivational and effective leadership leading field research teams of up to 10 personnel into wilderness conditions, and led laboratory discussions on the use of Git and R Markdown to improve organization of research.
- Communicated results to statistical and ecological audiences nationally and internationally.
